## Introduction

The [Civilian Unemployment Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is generally considered an important indicator of the overall health of the United States Economy, and is frequently cited by politicians seeking office or hoping to retain it.

Once of the hallmarks of a competitive economy in the modern globalized world is diversity of output relative to input. This is evidenced by the modern success of countries such as Israel, a veritable sandbar in the Middle East which has experienced growth approaching and sometimes surpassing its neighbor Iran, a nation with ten times the population, a multi-century head start, and vast oil reserves.

The erratic peaks and valleys of the oft-sanctioned and commodity-driven Iranian economy are shown above alongside the relatively constant growth of the more tech-centric Israeli economy.

An unintended but unavoidable side effect of any evolving economy is the inevitable obsolescence which occurs in industries outsourced by either happenstance or design. This phenomena results in an observable difference in the way economic downturn affects a society.

## Measuring Unemployment

The raw unemployment rate shown above, along with all data used for this research, is sourced from the Federal Reserve Data service [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) and is supplemented below by the number of new Unemployment Insurance claims filed on average per month and per year.

Roughly speaking, these two datasets follow the same general course but the latter is often used as an indicator of unemployment figures in the near future, as an increase or decrease in the number of new claims is likely to foreshadow the same trend in overall unemployment.

The chart below contrasts these two series on a duel-axis and compares their relative changes.

The more-than-casual relationship between these two metrics is visible when they are compared side-by-side.

## Capacity Usage

An essential measurement of how an economic systems uses what resources are available to it is called capacity utilization. In sum, this is a function of the total potential for production versus the actual production achieved.

More than a handful of economists and politicians have pointed to the overall decline of American manufacturing, in favor of outsourcing those jobs to developing countries most often.

The declining capacity usage of the United States since 1970 indicates highlights the decrease in local production and manufacturing, despite the relative abundance of natural resources.

Another interesting pattern is the relationship between unemployment and the production- and manufacturing-centric capacity usage series.

The visualization below places these series in one visualization, highlighting the nature of their relationship.
