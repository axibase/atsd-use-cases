[Forecast Settings](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/forecasting/) are a set of rules to predict future data by applying a statistical algorithm to historical records.  The choice of the algorithm and parameters may be manually-specified by an expert user or automatically selected by ATSD based on the built-in scoring system.

Follow this process to upload a forecast configuration to your local ATSD instance.

1. Expand the **Data** menu and select **Forecast Jobs**.
