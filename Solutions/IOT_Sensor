### Overview

The eponymous Internet of Things (IoT) movement has come a long way since the term was coined in 1999. Regardless of whether
the topic is media, security, engineering, automation, or a mixture of all four, IoT inter-networking practices, in conjunction
with widespread cloud-integration, have created the opportunity to deploy a range of innovative solutions that are changing the way
people relate to the physical world.

The sheer number of "things" already working within some kind of IoT infrastructure is overwhelming enough, and analysts estimate that number
will continue to grow to almost thirty billion by 2020. Furthermore, the functionality of IoT infrastructure is reaching levels engineers
could only dream of in 1982 when researchers at Carnegie Mellon University debuted the first "smart" device, a Coca Cola vending machine
connected to the internet that was able to report its inventory and temperature statistics by monitoring a 
number of internal sensors that communicated with a local machine on campus.

### Functionality

The [Axibase Time Series Database](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/) is a purpose-built solution for analyzing and reporting on massive volumes of time-series
data collected at high frequency which makes it ideal for integration into IoT systems. With robust functionality that is
not hindered by verbose operational syntax, ATSD is able to effectively perform within any environment without hampering an already
existing work flow.

An in-built [structured query language](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/tree/master/api/sql#overview) (SQL) features a full range of both standard and innovative commands, settings, and
options that allow ATSD users to distinguish themselves with meaningful analytics and fully customizable scheduled
querying. Additionally, export control settings allow credentialed users to manage access to information with ease, release on-schedule
reports, and monitor targeted outcomes via complete reporting automation after an initial configuration.

Powerful visualization tools supported in ATSD and the accessory sandbox app [ChartLab](https://apps.axibase.com) reach end users and internal staff alike with 
comprehensive dashboards that support total customization and on-the-fly modification for unrivaled data presentation.

### Real-Time Monitoring

Axibase data scientists operate at the vanguard of the industry, spearheading a range of big data projects that increase our
visibility and the visibility of our partners and clients. Our innovative approach to solution management is
demonstrated by [integration and partnership](https://www-304.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?solution=27657&lc=en&stateCd=P&tab=2) 
with industry forerunners and projects such as our [2015 cloud oktas algorithm](https://axibase.com/calculating-cloud-oktas/) which innovated a new way to predict solar power production
in Austrailia using live data monitoring from ceilometers across the country.

This project is detailed below in three parts, demonstrating the interconnected functionality of ATSD that our elite development team
has produced.

### Debrief

The Axibase Time Series Database is the ideal tool for organizations interested in maximizing the output of their analytics
infrastructure. It is designed to seamlessly manage complex work flows and is [built for integration](https://github.com/axibase/atsd#integrations) 
in to a number of industry standard advanced analytics tools. Real-time monitoring may be automated after initial configuration
and both numeric and visual outputs features can be deployed for flawless presentation of time series data.
