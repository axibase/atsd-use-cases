Analyzing Econometric Datasets with Calculated Series
===

![](images/FRED_logo.jpg)

### Summary

Using [calculated values](../Support/Add-Calculated-Values/README.md) in the [ChartLab](https://apps.axibase.com) interface
is useful for creating multiple outputs from one set of underlying data. [Axibase Time Series Database](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/)
supports a range of in-built functions which allow end-users to manipulate a dataset to derive the desired meaning from it.

The St. Louis branch of the Federal Reserve branch maintains FRED, short for [Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), an 
open-access platform for analyzing the data collected and published by the Federal Reserve. One important metric tracked
by FRED is the **CPIAUCSL** - [Consumer Price Index](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#0), shortened as CPI. The Consumer Price
Index is used to track inflation by measuring the costs of goods relative to some year. 

### Problem Brief

Using a number of functions supported in the ChartLab interface, the [following visualization](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#0)
can be replicated in ATSD. Explore the FRED visualization with the _EDIT GRAPH_ button by selecting the desired
output. To learn more about how any of the metrics are calculated from the underlying data, the [following page](https://fredhelp.stlouisfed.org/fred/data/understanding-the-data/formulas-calculate-growth-rates/)
provides information about the formulas used to modify the original series. A brief tutorial on data modification in the
FRED interface is shown below:

![](images/tut-1.png)

* Open the transformation interface by clicking the highlighted _EDIT GRAPH_ button above.

![](images/tut-2.png)

* Under the _Units_ dropdown, select the desired transformation.

![](images/tut-3.png)

* Modify any sub-features of the transformation necessary for the required output.

### Solution

A side-by-side comparison of each feature of the Consumer Price Index transformation is shown below, as well as links to the accompanying
visualizations. Because ATSD supports storing historical data from the year 1970 onward while the Federal Reserve tracks
data from 1947 onward, small scale differences are expected in the outputs of each graph.

#### Consumer Price Index

The Consumer Price Index is one of the most relevant metrics used to calculate the rate and severity of inflation.

#### CPI Calculated from a Variable Baseline

The index is the year used as a baseline for all other years' values. Years which showed an increase in the cost of consumer
goods will therefore be greater than 100.00 while years which saw deflation in the cost of consumer goods will be less than
100.00.

> In ChartLab, use the dropdown menu at the top of the visualization to selet the year to be used as a baseline, or hardcode
a year not included in the dropdown by modifying one of the dates in the _keyDates_ list.

**Key Components of This Visualization**: 

> Open the ChartLab visualization shown above and view the Editor window to see these features of the chart. 

* The list _keyDates_ contains the same dates as the FRED chart referenced in the [Problem Brief](#problem-brief):

```javascript
list keyDates = 1970-11-01, 
  1973-11-01, 1975-03-01,
  1980-01-01, 1980-07-01, 
  1981-07-01, 1982-11-01,
  1990-07-01, 1991-03-01, 
  2001-03-01, 2001-11-01,
  2007-12-01, 2009-06-01
endlist
```

* These dates are fed into the dropdown menu which represent the official start dates of several recessions throughout U.S.
history. The syntax for this chart's dropdown menu is shown below:

```ls
  [dropdown]
    on-change = widget.config.series[0].value = this.value; widget.replaceSeries(widget.config.series);
    for date in keyDates
      [option]
        text = Index (Scale to 100 for @{date})
        value = value("cpi") / value("cpi_@{date}") * 100 || null
    endfor
 ```
> For more information about the above syntax see the following [documentation](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/dropdown/).

By modifying any of the dates contained in the _keyDates_ list above, the user can select any desired date to set as the
baseline value, and the `value` equation contained in the `[option]` portion of the `[dropdown]` configuration above uses 
a simple formula to establish the new index. The `on-change` setting defines this newly calculated series, and is explained
piecewise below:

* `widget.config.series[0]` selects the series to be replaced. Series are indexed beginning with 0 and increasing by a single
step for each additional series (0,1,2,3....). There is only one underlying series in this visualization.
* `value = this.value` assigns a user-defined value, that is, the option selected in the dropdown menu, as the value for
the series defined in the the `widget.config` portion of the script. `this` defines the specific object to be modified, in this
case the dropdown menu.
* `widget.replaceSeries(widget.config.series)` replaces the underlying values of the original series defined as a parameter
of the function, with the newly calculated values defined in the `[option]` setting.

``` 
* This setting uses a second underlying series which is not enabled, to select values of the Consumer Price Index from one year
ago using a [`time-offset`](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/time-chart/) setting,
and comparing them to the current year's values.
