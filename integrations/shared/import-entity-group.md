Entity Groups provide a way to organize similar entities into logical collections. These groups may be operated upon as aggregates by a user when managing permissions, filtering data, calculating statistics, etc.

For more information on entity groups, see the [ATSD Documentation](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/configuration/entity_groups.html).

Follow this procedure to import an Entity Group definition to your local ATSD instance.
