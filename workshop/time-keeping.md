## Overview

To maintain accurate time zones requires precise methods of time keeping. This workshop explores the evolution of methods of time keeping from Antiquity to the the modern age, concluding roughly upon the outbreak of the First World War.

## Ancient Time Keeping

Early time keeping methods were localized. Very few municipal standardization methods emerged until the Late Middle Ages (1250-1500).

### Antiquity

* **1500 BCE**: Oldest extant continuous time-keeping device found in the Valley of the Kings.<sup>[2](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Sundials.html)</sup>
  * Nocturnal time keeping impossible.
  * Discrete measurement imprecise.
  * Changing location changes measurement.

* **200 BCE**: Water clocks used for discrete measurements of time during the Han dynasty.<sup>[3](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/696219)</sup>
  * Nocturnal time keeping introduced.
  * Tedious to maintain.

Phenomenon tracked by the device were observed and studied by Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the second century BCE, as such, he is thought to have been involved in its creation and design.

### Middle Ages

* Three distinct periods, none of which are particularly good for time-keeping advancements:
  * Early Middle Ages: **400 - 999 CE**
  * High Middle Ages: **1000 - 1249 CE**
  * Late Middle Ages: **1250 - 1500 CE**
* **300 - 1200 CE**: The development of continuous escapement mechanisms.<sup>[4](https://www.mas.bg.ac.rs/_media/istrazivanje/fme/vol40/1/03_mstoimenov.pdf)</sup> The [sliding rope paradox](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.1586.pdf) remains unsolved until the invention of calculus in the 17th century.

  * Burgundian Wars (1474-1477)

  * Rapid Ottoman expansion.

### Age of Exploration

> *Map of the New World*, Sebastian MÃ¼nster, 1540

* **1507**: Amerigo Vespucci demonstrates that what will come to be known as the Americas are not connected to Asia, but represent a "fourth area" of the world.<sup>[8](https://www.history.com/topics/exploration/amerigo-vespucci)</sup>
* **1657**: The first pendulum clock is patented on 16 June by Christiaan Huygens in the Spanish Netherlands;<sup>[9](https://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/dutch%20republic.htm)</sup> this method will remain the most accurate way of keeping time until the 1930s.<sup>[10](http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/~adrian/timekeeping/galileo/)</sup>
  * Entire process is uniform.
  * Maintenance is trivial.
  * Precise time-keeping technology paves the road for Enlightenment thinkers to perform repeatable scientific experimentation.

* **1675**: Greenwich Mean Time established to aid mariners in the calculation of longitude.<sup>[11](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1970JBAA...80..208H)</sup>
* **1698**: Thomas Savery invents the steam engine.<sup>[12](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~lira/supp/steam/)</sup>
* **1715**: The death of Louis XIV marks the beginning of the Age of Enlightenment.

## Early Time Zones

The Age of Enlightenment (1715-1799) fostered growth in every area of human life; the Romantic period (1800-1850) brought the world closer together through globalization.

### Navigational Necessity

* The advent of long-distance water-based travel necessitated the use of celestial phenomenon for navigational purposes.
* **1731**: Longitude derived using tools of the Age of Exploration such as the sextant.<sup>[13](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~helios/Mestre/Novemb00/H61iflan.htm)</sup>

### Expansion and Standardization

* The locomotive is invented in **1804** by Richard Trevithick.<sup>[14](https://railroad.lindahall.org/essays/locomotives.html)</sup>
* The emergence of railroad networks created the need for coordinated time across vast distances relative to multiple positions.

  ![](./images/tz-17.png)

* **1847**: Using telegraph technology, time signals are transmitted great distances across Great Britain (~1,000 km) to coordinate railroad activities and thus became known as *Railway time*.<sup>[15](https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/transport/onlineatlas/railways.pdf)</sup>
* **New Zealand Mean Time** (GMT +11:30): The first recognized time zone established in **1868**.<sup>[16](https://teara.govt.nz/en/timekeeping/print)</sup>
* Other railroad systems were far less compact, and therefore able to function using far sloppier time keeping methods.
  * Local standardization in the Russian Empire occurred in **1880** with the introduction of **Moscow Mean Time** which was unaffiliated with GMT.<sup>[17](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)</sup>
  * North American standardization occurred in **1883**, with major railroad stations used as delimiting points.<sup>[18](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-standardization-time-changed-american-society-180961503/)</sup>
  * By **1884**, 85% of American cities used GMT standardized time.
    * Detroit: Operated on non-standard local time until **1900**, then Central Standard Time, local mean time, and Eastern Standard Time before a May 1915 ordinance settled on EST and was ratified by popular vote in August 1916.
  * The Soviet Union standardized **Moscow Time** to GMT +2:00 in **1919**, as well as other Russian time zones, and implemented the use of the Gregorian calendar.
