## Overview

### Timeline

* Ancient time was regulated with [apparent solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time#Apparent_solar_time).
* In 1675, Greenwich Mean Time was established to aid mariners in the calculation of longitude.
* The advanced mechanization of time keeping allowed the use of an atomic [mean solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time#Mean_solar_time) for larger regions by the nineteenth century.

### Technology

* **4000 BCE**: Water clocks used for discrete measurements of time.

* **1500 BCE**: Oldest extent continuous time-keeping device found in the [Valley of the Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_the_Kings).

* **300 - 1100 CE**: The development of continuous escapement mechanisms.
* **1237 CE**: The development of verge escapement by [Villard de Honnecourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villard_de_Honnecourt). Pendulum clocks remain the most accurate time keeping devices until the 1930s.

## Apparent Solar Time

* Apparent solar day is derived via measurement of one complete solar cycle.
* Problems:
  * Elliptical orbit of Earth around the sun.
  * Imperfect rotational axis.
  * Spherical shape of the planet.

## Mean Solar Time

* Day begins at 00:00 which corresponds to midnight, 12:00 is set at the zenith of the sun.
* Mean solar day is calculated based on a one year solar cycle.

## Early Necessity

* The advent of long-distance water-based travel necessitated the use of celestial phenomena for navigational purposes.
* **1731**: Longitude derived using tools of the Age of Exploration such as the [sextant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextant).
* Greenwich Mean Time was established to standardize a comparative value for London-based mariners.

## Expansion and Standardization

* The emergence of railroad networks created the need for coordinated time across vast distances relative to multiple positions.

* **1847**: Using telegraph technology, time signals were transmitted great distances across Great Britain (~1,350 km) to coordinate railroad activities and thus became known as [Railway time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone#Railway_time).
* **New Zealand Mean Time** (GMT +11:30): The first recognized time zone.
* Other railroad systems were far less compact, and therefore able to function using far sloppier time keeping methods.
  * North American standardization occurred in **1883**, with major railroad stations used as delimiting points.
  * By 1884, 85% of American cities used standardized time.
  * Detroit: Operated on non-standard local time until 1900, then Central Standard Time, local mean time, and Eastern Standard Time before a May 1915 ordinance settled on EST and was ratified by popular vote in August 1916.
  * Standardization in the Russian Empire occurred in **1880** with the introduction of **Moscow Mean Time** which was unaffiliated with GMT.
  * The Soviet Union standardized **Moscow Time** to GMT +2:00, as well as other Russian time zones, and implemented the use of the Gregorian calendar.

## International Time Zones

* First proposed in 1858 by Italian mathematician [Quirico Filopanti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirico_Filopanti).
* Scottish-Canadian [Sandford Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandford_Fleming) successfully proposed the creation of a "universal time," which all other time zones would eventually be based on in 1879.
* By 1900, nearly every country had approximately standardized its own time, but international cooperation was still rare.
* Between 1900-1929 all major countries standardized their own time to a derivation of GMT.
* 1956: Nepal is the last country to standardize its time to GMT.
