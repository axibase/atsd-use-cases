# United States Federal Reserve: The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index

### Introduction

Published in 2015 by the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a paper entitled [Measuring Economic
Policy Uncertainty](http://www.policyuncertainty.com/media/BakerBloomDavis.pdf) seeks to establish a set of clear guidelines 
for quantifying economic policy uncertainty: 

* **Who** is responsible for making economic policy descisions? 
* **What** economic policy will be enacted? 
* What **effects** will that policy have on the local economy?

According to the authors (Baker, Bloom, and Davis), their EPU (Economic Policy Uncertainty) metric is able to accurately
predict economic growth and investment by tracking geopolitical events such as international treaties, public information like
newpapers and policy position releases, and actual actions undertaken by government bodies such as a central bank raising
interest rates.
