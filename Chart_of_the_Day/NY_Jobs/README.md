Running New York City is a big business. In fact, according to [data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/jobs-by-industry)
released by the State of New York that tracks employment figures by industry, the top two industries
are partially staffed or entirely staffed by government employees and the third position
is sure to include government staffers on the payroll as well. That's big news considering 
the state's annual budget for the current fiscal year (2017) was ranked second in the union at a whopping 
[$153 billion dollars](https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/articles/senate-passes-2017-18-state-budget-protects-taxpayers-provides-record-investments)
and the City of New York has its own [local budget](http://council.nyc.gov/budget/) that totals about half that number as well.
New York City and State officials have stood behind the expansion and implementation of the Affordable Care Act 
locally, which has seen the health care and social assistance industry add over 100,000 new jobs over the past four 
years in the Big Apple alone.

Additionally, the number of working government positions in the city has increased by roughly 38,000
and using the [SQL Console](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/tree/master/api/sql) from the [Axibase Time Series Database](https://axibase.com),
New York City figures can be compared to New York State figures:
