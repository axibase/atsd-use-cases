The overnight market is the shortest term loan market available, whereby banks loans money overnight which must be repayed the following morning plus interest. Because of the extreme short term nature of these types of loans, they also have some of the lowest interest rates - typically reflective of the target interest rate mandated by the United States Federal Reserve.

This week, the Fed [announced](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43489661) it was going to increase its target interest rate by 0.25% from 1.5% to 1.75% citing a stronger economic outlook in the future as a justification for the move. Fed Chairman Jay Powell also cited plans to increase the effective rate two more times during 2018.
