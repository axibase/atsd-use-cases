Since credit card loan delinquency rose to almost seven percent at the height of the most recent global recession, United States
consumers have shown a positive trend in reducing the percent of consumers paying off their personal credit card debt delinquently.
Credit card loan delinquency is often a sign of downturn in the amount of household income present and puts a strain on 
loan outfits who may not be prepared to not recoup those assets.

The visualization above tracks credit card loan delinquency by quarter from 1991 to the most recent second quarter data from 2017.
The black line tracks the three year average of that delinquency rate and if a given quarter is higher than the three-year
average value, it is shown in red. Although American consumers have been ahead of the curve for the majority of the time 
since the recession ended, the last four consecutive quarters have shown higher than average delinquency rates.

The graph on the bottom left tracks the annual average delinquency rate, while the graph on the bottom right tracks the 
quarterly percent change in delinquency rate.
