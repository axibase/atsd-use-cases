500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health
===

Learning about your favorite city's local health has never been easier. With help from 
[data](https://github.com/axibase/open-data-catalog/blob/master/datasets/dxpw-cm5u.md) released by [The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) (CDC) plus 
visualization and querying tools from [Axibase](https://axibase.com), spotting your city's place in the rankings
isn't just for your health, but vital to informing your company's next health-related venture
or enhancing your staff's already existing knowledge of such valuable public data.

The [500 Cities Project](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/index.htm) uses self-reporting and census-style data-gathering methodology
to engage in the country-wide conversation about public health using small-area samples from the 500 largest cities in the nation. 
That means cities like Los Angeles and New York are broken up into smaller segments to give a better picture of
any given location's public health indicators. The information is then presented in a straightforward 
and easy to understand format that simply shows the percent of respondents who answered in the affirmative to a particular question,
creating simple solutions for sometimes complex data problems.

So which US city really is the healthiest? Well if you ask them, almost 20% of Youngstown,
Ohio residents responded positively when asked in they were in good health.

Of course, physical health is only half of the total picture; mental health is another\
important metric for gauging overall public health, so which city has the most
stable demeanor, and perhaps more interestingly, what city considers itself to have
the lowest level of mental health?
