The [American Enterprise Institute](http://www.aei.org/) is Washington D.C.-based conservative think tank that is dedicated to researching issues of government, politics, economics, and social welfare. Recently they published an [article](http://www.aei.org/publication/the-public-thinks-the-average-company-makes-a-36-profit-margin-which-is-about-5x-too-high-part-ii/) which described the average American's perception of the profit margins that companies from various industries are able to make on a consistent basis.

The article drew information from a variety of polling agencies who had sampled large groups of the population and came away with the conclusion that the average American believes most companies, regardless of industry are consistently making profits on the order of 36%. Using data from NYU professor and researcher [Aswath Damodaran](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/home.htm) AEI came to the conclusion that the average Americans estimated was off by a factor of about 5. They concluded that the average company makes around 7.9% after taxes and about 10 points lower, 6.9% if the financial industry is excluded.
