Living in the city has always been a "take the good with the bad" compromise. On the upside, there's the culture and the
location, but on the downside there's the other people there messing it all up. The City of Seattle, like most metropolitan
areas, has a number of methods for community members to reach out and draw the government's attention to a particularly egregious
problem and as of the last year, they've begun to publish the number of complaints they receive every month about the seven
most reported problems.

The chart, made in [ChartLab](https://apps.axibase.com) from [Axibase](https://axibase.com), at the top of the screen shows the total number of complaints received from the beginning of the dataset last July all the way up
until a few months ago, in June, and the chart below details the complaints by month. Use the drop-down menu at the top of
the visualization to change the subject of the complaint and see for yourself the changing rates of Seattle's main complaints.

It seems hard to believe, but according to these figures, the city government receives something on the order of 100 daily
complaints about abandoned vehicles littering the city, and an additional 50 or so about illegal dumping taking place. Knowing
that, it's not difficult to understand how committed the residents of Seattle are to keeping the Emerald City green.
