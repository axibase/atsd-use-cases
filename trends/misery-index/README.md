## Overview

The misery index is an economic metric which combines the inflation rate and unemployment rate to track the state of a particular economy. The derived metric was created by [Arthur Okun](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-brookings-institutions-arthur-okun-father-of-the-misery-index/) in the seventies.

Currently, the misery index is at the lowest its been since the early 2000s.
