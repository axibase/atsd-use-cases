# The Misery Index, Revisited

## Overview

><b><big>*Misery Index*</big></b> = *Unemployment Rate (%)* + *Inflation Rate (%)*

* The Misery Index was created in the seventies by American economist [Arthur Okun](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-brookings-institutions-arthur-okun-father-of-the-misery-index/) to track the combined values of unemployment and inflation.
* The Misery Index was created during the OPEC embargo on western nations, a period which saw both high inflation and high unemployment.<sup>[1](https://online.scu.edu.au/blog/what-is-stagflation-and-how-can-it-happen/)</sup>
* Typically, the Misery Index is considered during times of high inflation and unemployment.
* The index is used as a baseline from which to judge the overall state of an economy.

Canadian newspaper *The Globe and Mail* predicted a low score for the Misery Index north of the Fronti√®re Internationale in 2015, attributing some of the success to low energy prices curbing inflation.<sup>[2](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/canadas-misery-index/article25112820/)</sup>

Use a [user-defined function](https://axibase.com/docs/charts/syntax/udf.html) to track custom metrics using the underlying Misery Index data:

* Remove `/*` multi-line comment `*/` surrounding derived `[series]`; click **Run**.

  ```ls
  /*
   [series]
     value = fred.PercentChangeFromYearAgo('mi')
     axis = right
     color = black
     style = opacity: 0.5;stroke-width:2
     format = percent
  */
  ```

* If necessary, replace `PercentChangeFromYearAgo()` function with any [included function](https://axibase.com/docs/charts/syntax/udf.html#examples).

French data is only stored for the period 1996-2018. Using [SQL Console](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/sql/sql-console.html) to query the data shows a significant gap in the value of unemployment and inflation.

```sql
SELECT datetime, (((inflation.value/LAG(inflation.value))-1)*100) AS "Inflation", unemployment.value AS "Unemployment", (((inflation.value/LAG(inflation.value))-1)*100) + unemployment.value AS "Misery Index"
  FROM LRUN74TTFRA156N AS unemployment
  JOIN FRACPIHICAINMEI AS inflation
WHERE datetime > '1995-01-01'
```
