# How to Build Availability Report for AWS Route53

## Overview

[AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) provides tools to automate DNS configuration in order to reliably connect external user requests to infrastructure running in AWS. In addition to domain registration, it provides dynamic routing services, including latency-based routing, GeoDNS, Geoproximity, and Weighted Round Robin (WRR).

A core Route53 functionality is the ability to configure [health checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-health-checks.html) that route incoming traffic to healthy endpoints and then independently monitor the health of that application and its endpoints.

An automation procedure, such as DNS change or instance restart, can be initiated once the health check status drops below a certain threshold.

Health checks are available for HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP protocols and may be executed from a variety of regions for resiliency.

Built-in monitoring charts provide an overview for a period of up to 2 weeks.

## Service Availability Dashboards

These health check statistics may be offloaded to [Axibase Time Series Database](http://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/) to create consolidated dashboards with custom thresholds for alerts and notifications.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

* Create an AWS [IAM account](https://github.com/axibase/axibase-collector/blob/master/jobs/aws-iam.md) to query CloudWatch statistics.
* Make sure 4GB RAM is available for the [ATSD sandbox](https://github.com/axibase/dockers/tree/atsd-sandbox) container.

### Launch ATSD Sandbox

Launch [ATSD sandbox](https://github.com/axibase/dockers/tree/atsd-sandbox) container on one of the Docker hosts:

```
docker run -d -p 8443:8443 -p 9443:9443 -p 8081:8081 \
  --name=atsd-sandbox \
  --env ATSD_IMPORT_PATH='https://github.com/axibase/atsd-use-cases/raw/master/how-to/aws/route53-health-checks/resources/aws-route53-xml.zip' \
  --env COLLECTOR_IMPORT_PATH='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axibase/atsd-use-cases/master/how-to/aws/route53-health-checks/resources/job_aws_aws-route53.xml' \
  axibase/atsd-sandbox:latest
```

The sandbox container includes both ATSD and [Axibase Collector](https://github.com/axibase/axibase-collector/blob/master/jobs/docker.md) instances.

The Collector instance installed in the sandbox container will be used to retrieve Route53 statistics from AWS CloudWatch and store them in ATSD.

Wait until the sandbox is initialized and 'All applications started.' message is displayed.

```
docker logs -f atsd-sandbox
```

Log in to ATSD user interface using `axibase` username and `axibase` password.

```
https://atsd_hostname:8443/
```


### Configure AWS Access Keys

Log in to Axibase Collector instance at `https://atsd_hostname:9443` using `axibase` username and `axibase` password.

In the **Jobs** drop-down menu, select **AWS** jobs.

> If the **aws-route53** job is not visible, be sure that the **Status** drop-down menu is displaying all jobs.

Open **us-east-1** configuration and specify AWS Access and Secret keys.

Confirm connectivity by clicking the **Test** button.

The response should contain a list of metrics for the enabled health checks.

```xml
<ListMetricsResponse xmlns="http://monitoring.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-08-01/">
  <ListMetricsResult>
    <Metrics>
      <member>
        <Namespace>AWS/Route53</Namespace>
        <MetricName>TimeToFirstByte</MetricName>
        <Dimensions>
          <member>
            <Name>HealthCheckId</Name>
            <Value>726bed8e-c205-47d7-9d26-f8e61799b1a3</Value>
          </member>
        </Dimensions>
      </member>
    </Metrics>
  </ListMetricsResult>
  <ResponseMetadata>
    <RequestId>01af0476-2911-11e8-8699-e53c6524cd7c</RequestId>
  </ResponseMetadata>
</ListMetricsResponse>
```

### Enable Job

From the **AWS Job** page, enable the **aws-route53** job. Click **Save**.

### Setup Health Check Attribute Copy

Configure a cron-scheduled task to copy health check attributes into ATSD sandbox as described [here](https://github.com/axibase/atsd-integration/tree/aws-route53)

## Results

### Consolidated View

All working Route53 health checks are now visible on the **AWS Route53** tab.
