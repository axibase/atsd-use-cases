# Configure Slack/Telegram Notifications for New GitHub Repository Subscriptions

### Overview

This guide shows how to configure GitHub to alert you when someone begins to watch your reposity. This feature allows you to monitor your repository's followers. Follow the instructions to configure the notifications to be sent to you directly through a third-party messenger service with [Axibase Time Series Database](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/).

### Purpose

Many repositories contain a broad range of code and documentation to which end-users may positively respond by subscribing. Turn your public repositories into market research and product experimentation with **Subscription Notifications**. New releases which generate a large number of subscriptions may be tracked without manually monitoring your watchlists, and obsolete repositiories which no longer garner much attention may be simplified and integrated to streamline your company's GitHub optics.

While the default email notifications delivered by GitHub provide a convenient way to stay on track, the flexibility of being able to track new subscribers can be better accomplished using programmatic integration leveraging GitHub webhook functionality.

### Launch ATSD Sandbox

Launch a local ATSD instance using the following sandbox image:

```
docker run -d -p 8443:8443 -p 9443:9443 -p 8081:8081 \
  --name=atsd-sandbox \
  --env SERVER_URL=https://example.com \
  --env WEBHOOK=github \
  --env ATSD_IMPORT_PATH='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axibase/atsd-use-cases/repo-notifications/how-to/github/resources/github-watch.xml' \
  axibase/atsd-sandbox:latest
```

Replace the `SERVER_URL` parameter in the command above with the public DNS name of the Docker host where the sandbox container will be running. The Docker host should be externally accessible to receive webhook notifications from GitHub servers.

For advanced launch settings refer to the following [guide](https://github.com/axibase/dockers/tree/atsd-sandbox).

Watch the sandbox container logs for `All applications started` line.

```
docker logs -f atsd-sandbox
```

Copy the newly-created GitHub webhook URL from the log output.

```
github webhook created:
https://github:password@atsd.company_name.com:8443/api/v1/messages/webhook/github?exclude=organization.*%3Brepository.*%3B*.signature%3B*.payload%3B*.sha%3B*.ref%3B*_at%3B*.id&include=repository.name&header.tag.event=X-GitHub-Event&excludeValues=http*&debug=true
```

### Create a GitHub Webhook

Open the **Settings** menu for the GitHub repository for which you would like to create notifications.

Select the **Webhooks** tab from the left-side menu and click **Add Webhook**.

On the **Add Webhook** page, configure the following settings:

* **Payload URL**: Copy the GitHub webhook URL from the Docker log.
* **Content Type**: Make sure you select `application/json`.
* Click **Disable SSL Verification** and confirm the setting.
* Select 'Send me everything', under **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?** and select **Watches**.

Be sure that your server is reachable by GitHub servers. For more information about configuring GitHub webhooks use the [developer guide](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/configuring/). 

Once your server and webhook have been properly configured, confirm connectivity at the bottom of the **Manage Webhook** page.

### Configure Web Notification

Configure your [messenger of choice](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/rule-engine/web-notifications.md#collaboration-services), for example:

* [Slack](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/rule-engine/notifications/slack.md)
* [Telegram](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/rule-engine/notifications/telegram.md)

In the ATSD environment, open the left-side **Alerts** menu and select **Web Notifications**.

Select the messenger which you've configured from the list on the **Web Notifications** page.

On the messenger-specific page, be sure that the **Web Notification** is enabled. In the **Auth Token** field, insert the authentication token you received from your messenger of choice. Configure additional parameters as needed such as **Bot Username** and click **Save**

On the **Web Notifications** tab, enable the rule. Click **Save**.

You'll begin receiving messenger notifications the next time a new subscriber begins to watch your GitHub repository.

**Repository** and **User** links will redirect you to the newly-watched repository and the newly-subscribed user, respectively.
