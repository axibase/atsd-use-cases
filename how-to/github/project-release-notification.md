# Configure Slack/Telegram Notifications for New GitHub Project Releases

### Overview

This guide shows how to configure GitHub to alert you when someone creates a new project in your repository. This feature allows you to monitor your repository and receive notifications the moment a project is created. Follow the instructions to configure the notifications to be sent directly to your repository collaborators through a third-party messenger service with [Axibase Time Series Database](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/).

### Purpose

Project management functionality in GitHub has evolved to enable users to to design, execute, and complete the projects associated with their code stored on GitHub without the need for an external plug-in. Many GitHub repositories contain thousands of lines of code and need to handle an increasing number of projects, especially those associated with larger organizations with employees across the globe.

While the default email notifications delivered by GitHub provide a convenient way to stay on track, the flexibility of watching new projects as they are created can be better accomplished using programmatic integration leveraging GitHub webhook functionality.

### Launch ATSD Sandbox

Launch an [ATSD Sandbox](https://github.com/axibase/dockers/tree/atsd-sandbox) container on Docker:

```
docker run -d -p 8443:8443 -p 9443:9443 \
  --name=atsd-sandbox \
  --env SERVER_URL=https://atsd.company_name.com:8443 \
  --env WEBHOOK=github \
  --env ATSD_IMPORT_PATH='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axibase/atsd-use-cases/repo-notifications/how-to/github/resources/github-project-create.xml' \
  axibase/atsd-sandbox:latest
```

Replace the `SERVER_URL` parameter in the command above with the public DNS name of the Docker host where the sandbox container will be running. The Docker host should be externally accessible to receive webhook notifications from GitHub servers.

For advanced launch settings refer to the following [guide](https://github.com/axibase/dockers/tree/atsd-sandbox).

Watch the sandbox container logs for `All applications started` line.

```
docker logs -f atsd-sandbox
```

Copy the newly-created GitHub webhook URL from the log output.

```
github webhook created:
https://github:password@atsd.company_name.com:8443/api/v1/messages/webhook/github?exclude=organization.*;repository.*;*.signature;*.payload;*.sha;*.ref;*_at;*.id&include=repository.name;repository.full_name&header.tag.event=X-GitHub-Event&excludeValues=http*&debug=true
```

### Create a GitHub Webhook

Open the **Settings** menu for the GitHub repository for which you would like to create notifications.

Select the **Webhooks** tab from the left-side menu and click **Add Webhook**.

On the **Add Webhook** page, configure the following settings:

* **Payload URL**: Copy the GitHub webhook URL from the Docker log. 
* **Content Type**: Make sure you select `application/json`.
* Click **Disable SSL Verification** and confirm the setting.
* Select 'Send me everything', under **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**.

Be sure that your server is reachable by GitHub servers. For more information about configuring GitHub webhooks use the [developer guide](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/configuring/). 

Once your ATSD server and webhook have been properly configured, confirm connectivity at the bottom of the **Manage Webhook** page.

### Confirm Connectivity

In the ATSD environment, open the left-side **Settings** menu, navigate to **Diagnostics** and click **Webhook Requests**.

### Configure Web Notification

Configure your [messenger of choice](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/rule-engine/web-notifications.md#collaboration-services), for example:

* [Slack](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/rule-engine/notifications/slack.md)
* [Telegram](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/rule-engine/notifications/telegram.md)

In ATSD, open the left-side **Alerts** menu and select **Web Notifications**.

Select the messenger which you've configured from the list on the **Web Notifications** page.

On the messenger-specific page, be sure that the **Web Notification** is enabled. In the **Auth Token** field, insert the authentication token you received from your messenger of choice. Configure additional parameters as needed such as **Bot Username** and click **Save**

### Configure Alert Rule to Process GitHub Webhook Requests

Navigate to the **Rules** page as shown here.

![](images/alerts-rules.png)

Open the rule configuration by clicking the link in the **Name** column.

On the **Web Notifications** tab, enable the rule. Click **Save**.

You'll begin receiving messenger notifications the next time a project is created in your GitHub repository.

**Repository**, **User**, and **Project** links will redirect you to the repository where the Project was created, the GitHub profile of the user who opened the PR, and the Project page itself, respectively.
