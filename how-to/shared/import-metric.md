Metrics are numeric measurements stored in ATSD. The [metric record](https://github.com/axibase/atsd/blob/master/api/meta/metric/list.md#fields) includes information about the measured attribute including its name, a user-friendly label, measurement units etc.

Follow this process to import metric definitions into your local ATSD instance.

1. Click the **Metrics** link in the toolbar on the left.
