A scheduled SQL query is executed by the database on schedule. When the query is executed, it can be configured to generate files on the local file syste, to send a report via email, or to produce calculated metrics and store them in the database.

Follow this process to add a new schedule SQL query to your local ATSD instance.

1. Expand the **SQL** menu and select **Scheduled Queries**.
