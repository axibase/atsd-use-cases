An entity configuration describes the monitored object. The [entity record](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/api/meta/entity/list.html#fields) includes information about the object such as the name, label, and custom tags.

Follow this process to import entity records into your local ATSD instance.

1. Click the **Entities** link in the toolbar on the left.

## Uploading Multiple Configuration Files

Note that multiple files may be uploaded together or as an archive by opening the **Settings** menu, expanding the **Diagnostics** section, selecting the **Backup Import** page, and completing the form to which you will be directed.
