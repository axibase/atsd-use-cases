Entity Views display a custom set of attributes and statistics for the members of a selected Entity Group. The information displayed by an entity view is presented in a tabular format and is updated when the page is refreshed. Add Entity Views to the top menu if needed. For more information on Entity Views, see the [ATSD Documentation](https://axibase.com/docs/atsd/configuration/entity_views.html).

Follow this process to upload an Entity View configuration to your local ATSD instance.
