![](images/portal.png)

### Overview

Axibase [**TRENDS**](https://trends.axibase.com/) is a data visualization sandbox based on the [ChartLab](https://apps.axibase.com/) API which relies on the [Axibase Time Series Database](https://axibase.com) for data storage and processing tasks. The **TRENDS** interface enables users to interact with the data that they are reading about and modify the visualizations to ask and answer questions without skewed visualization or biased information.

### Syntax

**TRENDS** uses a convenient [syntax](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/) for data modification that will be briefly discussed in this guide.
